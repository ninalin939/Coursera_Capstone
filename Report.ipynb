Since majority of the families are looking to expand and grow, they are looking to a place with high standards of living and quality of life. Thus, they have narrowed the locations down to Scarborough, Canada. They need a data scientist to analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto and New York. The Capstone Project will outline the methodology in solving the problem. By comparing neighborhoods between the two cities, the capstone will conclude with the neighborhoods that will be optimal for the startup."

For example, if the family enjoys fitness, they might want to consider Alderwood, Long Branch because the gym is the most frequented venue. If they enjoy nature, they would consider Bayview village because the park and trail are more frequented than other venues. If they were an Asian immigrant, Agincourt would be a great choice due to growing Asian venues in the neighborhood."
